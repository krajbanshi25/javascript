#Implementing Control Flow and Conditional Statements

##What you will learn

In this lab, you will delve into the fundamental concept of control flow and conditional statements in JavaScript. Through hands-on implementation, you will grasp the essence of ifâ€¦else statements, nested statements, and switch statements, understanding how these structures enable code execution based on specific conditions. You will gain insight into how altering these elements impacts the program's flow and output.
Learning objectives

##After completing this lab, you will be able to:

    Decision-making constructs: Learn about if statements for single-condition execution, if else statements to execute different code blocks based on conditions, and nested if else statements to handle multiple conditions hierarchically.

    Control flow and efficiency: Explore logical flow control to manage program flow based on conditions and code optimization to enhance readability and efficiency.

    Handling multiple scenarios: Understand how to manage complexity to deal with multiple conditions effectively and switch statements to streamline code for multiple scenarios.

    Real-world application and problem-solving: Learn about applied problem solving to utilize conditional statements in practical scenarios and enhanced logic building to strengthen problem-solving skills through logic constructs.

##Prerequisites:

    Basic knowledge of HTML and Git commands.

    Basic understanding of JavaScript control flow and conditional statements such as if, if else, and switch case.

    Web browser with a console (Chrome DevTools, Firefox Console, and so on).
