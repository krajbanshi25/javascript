#Develop Colorful Memory Match Game Using JavaScript DOM

##What you will learn

In this lab, you will learn the fundamentals of building a memory matching game using HTML and JavaScript. You will understand how to dynamically generate game elements, such as cards with various colors, handle click events to reveal and match colors, implement a basic scoring system that increments upon successful matches, create a timer mechanism to limit game time and initiate game restart functionalities. Through this lab, you will grasp key concepts of DOM manipulation, event handling, array manipulation (shuffling), and basic game logic, offering practical insight into creating interactive web-based games.
Learning objectives

##After completing this lab, you will be able to:

    DOM manipulation: Understand and implement dynamic HTML element creation and modification using JavaScript to generate a playable memory matching game grid.

    Event handling: Learn to manage and respond to user interactions by handling click events on game cards, revealing colors, and implementing logic for matching pairs.

    Game logic implementation: Develop fundamental game logic by incorporating mechanisms to match pairs of colors, track scores, reset the game, and manage game time through a simple timer.

    Fundamentals of web game development: Gain insights into core concepts essential for creating interactive web-based games, including array manipulation for shuffling elements, styling elements with CSS, and integrating JavaScript functionalities for game interactivity and dynamics.

##Prerequisites

    Basic knowledge of HTML and GitHub.

    Web browser with a console (Chrome DevTools, Firefox Console, and so on).

#Summary

    HTML structure: Defines a game titled "Colorful Memory Match Game." It includes elements for the game grid, score, timer, and a start/restart button.

    Styling: Applies CSS to create a visually appealing layout with specific colors, fonts, and button styles.

    JavaScript functions:
        generateCards(): Creates card elements with colors for the game.
        shuffle(array): Randomizes the order of elements in an array.
        handleCardClick(event): Manages card clicks and checks for matches.
        startGame(): Resets the game, shuffles cards, and starts a timer.

    Event listeners: Listens for clicks on the start/restart button to initialize the game. Listens for card clicks to reveal colors and check for matching pairs.
