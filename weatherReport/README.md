#Call API to Fetch Weather Data Using fetch()

#What you will learn

In this lab, you will integrate an external API OpenWeatherMap into a web application using JavaScript. You will learn how to fetch data asynchronously, parse JSON responses, and dynamically update the webpage based on the received information. You will understand the core concepts of API integration, asynchronous operations, DOM manipulation, and user interaction, providing a foundational understanding of web development practices for utilizing external data sources in a simple interface.
Learning objective

##After completing this lab, you will be able to:

    User-friendly weather retrieval: Enable user input for city names, facilitating the retrieval of real-time weather information via an intuitive web interface.

    API integration for weather data: Utilize the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch precise weather data based on user-entered cities, dynamically displaying temperature and weather descriptions on the webpage.

    HTML form submission handling and JS event implementation: Manage form submissions within HTML and implement event listeners in JavaScript, ensuring smooth user interactions and data retrieval processes.

    Demonstration of asynchronous requests and dynamic DOM updates: Showcase the practical application of asynchronous requests using fetch(), parsing JSON responses, and dynamically updating the DOM to display fetched weather details seamlessly, eliminating the need for page refreshes.

##Prerequisites

    Basic Knowledge of HTML.

    Web browser with a console (Chrome DevTools, Firefox Console, and so on).
