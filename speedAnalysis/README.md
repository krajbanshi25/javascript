#Create Text Analysis Tool for Speed Testing Using String Manipulations

##What you will learn

In this lab, you will engage in string methods to create type testing functionality, enhancing their typing speed and accuracy and gaining insights into JavaScript's interaction with HTML elements. By practicing common phrases and receiving immediate feedback on metrics like words typed and words per minute (WPM), users can track their progress and identify areas for improvement.
Learning objective

##After completing this lab, you will be able to:

    Implementing a typing test interface: Develop an interactive web interface using HTML and JavaScript. Create separate text areas for displaying predefined text and capturing user input. Set up a functional button to initiate and conclude the typing test seamlessly.

    Managing Ttst execution and result display: Establish JavaScript functions to control the test flow. Initialize the test environment by populating the predefined text for users to type. Capture user input, calculate crucial typing metrics (words typed, time elapsed), and compute the typing speed of words per minute (WPM).

    Providing immediate feedback and analysis: Enable real-time display of essential test results upon test completion. Showcase test statistics such as the number of words typed, time taken, and WPM to provide users with immediate feedback on their typing performance.

    Facilitating iterative learning and user experience: Offer a user-friendly platform for practicing typing skills, encouraging user engagement and interaction. Provide a platform allowing users to track their progress, learn from immediate feedback, and improve their typing speed and accuracy.

##Prerequisites

    Basic Knowledge of HTML and Git commands.

    Basic understanding of JavaScript functions and string manipulation methods.

    Web browser with a console (Chrome DevTools, Firefox Console, and so on).
